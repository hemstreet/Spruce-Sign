This module provides native bindings to the
[rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x) library by Jeremy Garff to
provide a very basic set of functions to write data to a strip of
ws2811/ws2812 LEDs. **this will only run on the Raspberry Pi.**

## setup

this module is available via npm:

    npm install rpi-ws281x-native

if you prefer installing from source:

    npm install -g node-gyp
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/raspberry-node/node-rpi-ws281x-native.git
    cd rpi-ws281x-native
    node-gyp rebuild


## usage

this module mainly exports four functions to send data to the LED-String.

```javascript
exports = {
    /**
     * configures PWM and DMA for sending data to the LEDs.
     *
     * @param {Number} numLeds  number of LEDs to be controlled
     * @param {?Object} options  (acutally only tested with default-values)
     *                           intialization-options for the library
     *                           (PWM frequency, DMA channel, GPIO, Brightness)
     */
    init: function(numLeds, options) {},

    /**
     * register a mapping to manipulate array-indices within the
     * data-array before rendering.
     *
     * @param {Array.<Number>} map  the mapping, indexed by destination.
     */
    setIndexMapping: function(map) {},

    /**
     * send data to the LED-strip.
     *
     * @param {Uint32Array} data  the pixel-data, 24bit per pixel in
     *                            RGB-format (0xff0000 is red).
     */
    render: function(data) {},

    /**
     * clears all LEDs, resets the PWM and DMA-parts and deallocates
     * all internal structures.
     */
    reset: function() {}
};
```

### Index-Mapping

As the wiring of the LEDs not neccessarily corresponds to the pixel-ordering in
the data-array, this module supports index-remapping. So, if you are building a
grid of LEDs you can just use an alternating, top-to-bottom or mirrored wiring
and use the remapping in order to use a unified structure in the incoming
data-arrays.

### Events

In addition to that, the exported object is an `EventEmitter` that will emit
the following Events:

 * `beforeRender`: emitted just before the data is prepared and sent to the
   LED-driver. The handler will receive the pixel-data array (an `Uint32Array`)
   as single argument. As this event is handled synchronously, you can use this
   to manipulate the data before it is sent to the LED-Strip.
 * `render`: emitted after the data has been sent to the LED-Strip. The single
   argument passed to the handler is the final pixel-data array, after
   index-remapping and gamma-correction.

## testing basic functionality

connect the WS2812-strip to the raspberry-pi as described
[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/wiring) and run
the command `node examples/rainbow.js <numLeds>`.
You should now see some rainbow-colors animation on the LED-strip.


## Hardware

There is a guide [over at adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi)
on how to get the hardware up and running. I followed these instructions by
the word and had a working LED-strip.

Essentially, you need the Raspberry Pi, a logic-level converter to shift the
output-voltage of the GPIO from 3.3V up to 5V (the guide mentions the 74AHCT125,
mine is an 74HCT125N which works just as well) and of course a LED-Strip or
other types of WS2812-LEDs.

To connect all that together, I'd recommend buying a small breadboard and some
jumper-wires. Also, consider buying a 5V power-supply that can deliver up to
60mA per LED (so you'll need up to 6A (30W) to fully power 100 LEDs).
For smaller applications, a decent USB-charger should do.

### Buying stuff

A short checklist of what you will need:

 * Raspberry-PI and SD-Card
 * 5V power-supply (Meanwell for instance builds really good ones)
 * LED-Strip with WS2811/WS2812 Controllers (there are several other
   controller-variations that are not supported)
 * a breadboard and some jumper-wires (m/m as well as at least two f/m to
   connect the GPIO-Pins)
 * a 3.3V to 5V logic-level converter (74AHCT125 or 74HCT125N, others will
   probably also work)
 * more wire to connect the LED-strips
